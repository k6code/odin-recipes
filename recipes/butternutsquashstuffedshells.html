<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 and 1/2 cups cubed butternut squash</li>
    <li>extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
    <li>16 jumbo shells</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cashew cream</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 and 1/2 cups raw cashews</li>
    <li>1 cup fresh water</li>
    <li>1 garlic clove</li>
    <li>3 and 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
    <li>freshly ground pepper</li>
</ul>

<h4>Filling</h4>
<ul>
    <li>4 cups fresh baby spinach</li>
    <li>1 cup crumbled firm tofu</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
    <li>pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1 cup cashew cream, from recipe above</li>
    <li>sea salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Toss the butternut squash with a drizzle of olive oil and a few generous pinches of salt and pepper. Roast until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Make the cashew cream: Blend together the drained raw cashews, fresh water, garlic, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Make the filling: In a medium skillet, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat. Add the spinach in increments, along with a pinch of salt, and sauté until all the spinach is incorporated and wilted. Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Squeeze out any excess liquid and chop. In a medium bowl, combine the the spinach with the crumbled tofu, oregano, lemon zest, red pepper flakes, at least 1/4 teaspoon salt, freshly ground black pepper and 1 cup of cashew cream. Season to taste, adding more salt and pepper as desired.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the shells and cook according to the package directions until al dente. Drain.</li>
    <li>Assemble the shells. Spread ¼ cup of the reserved cashew cream on the bottom of an 11x7-inch baking dish. Fill each cooked shell with some of the filling and a few cubes of butternut squash, and place into the baking dish. Drizzle a little olive oil over the shells, cover with foil, and bake for 15 minutes, or until heated through. Remove from the oven and serve with the remaining cashew cream.</li>
